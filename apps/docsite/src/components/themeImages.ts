/**
 * Per-theme product image registry.
 *
 * Each theme can ship its own set of 6 product photos (watch, headphones,
 * backpack, wallet, mug, throw). These images appear in two places on the
 * dedicated /themes/<name> page:
 *
 *   1. ThemeShowcasePreview — the live themed fake "Studio" app, where the
 *      first three (watch, headphones, backpack) render as 1:1 product
 *      card photos.
 *   2. ThemeCardShowcase — the inventory table thumbnails, which use all
 *      six.
 *
 * Adding photos for a new theme:
 *   1. Drop the 6 PNGs into public/<theme-slug>/preview-<item>.png
 *   2. Add an entry to THEME_IMAGES below pointing at those paths
 *   3. That's it — both consumers pick them up automatically
 *
 * Themes not listed in THEME_IMAGES fall back to the neutral image set,
 * so the page never has missing thumbnails — just the most neutral
 * possible product photos until a bespoke set lands.
