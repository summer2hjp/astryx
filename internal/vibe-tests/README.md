# Vibe Tests

Vibeability test harness for measuring how well LLMs can use the XDS component system.

## Quick Start - Interactive Mode (Navi / Claude Code)

Run vibe tests interactively through Navi (the AI assistant) using sub-agents — no API key needed. The skill doc is auto-generated from the CLI before each run, so it always reflects the current branch's components.

```
/vibe-test 5
```

Or ask Navi:

```
"Run a vibe test with 5 samples"
```

This will:

1. Generate the skill doc from source (auto-discovers components)
2. Set up a test iteration
3. Spawn parallel sub-agents to run each test
4. Write results to runs.jsonl
5. Aggregate and show results

### How It Works (Interactive)

When running interactively through Navi:

1. **Generate skill doc** — Runs `bash scripts/generate-skill-doc.sh` which uses the XDS CLI to auto-discover components from source and generate `.generated/xds-skill.md`
2. **Setup iteration** — Creates task files and manifest in `results/<iteration>/`
3. **Spawn sub-agents** — Each test prompt is run by a parallel sub-agent that:
   - Reads the generated skill doc as context
   - Generates code for the prompt using XDS components
   - Self-evaluates the response
4. **Aggregate** — Results are written to `runs.jsonl` and aggregated into a report

The skill doc is generated fresh each time, so it always reflects the current branch's components. No manual maintenance of component lists needed.

## Quick Start - API Mode

```bash
# Requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (direct Anthropic mode)
yarn workspace @xds/vibe-tests test:xds:sample

# Or use the Navi-orchestrated pipeline (no API key needed):
# 1. Navi sub-agents generate TSX results
# 2. GHA builds previews and captures screenshots
# See: .github/workflows/vibe-screenshots.yml
```

## What It Does

The harness:

1. **Tests** LLM responses against the component system using realistic prompts
2. **Evaluates** whether the LLM used the right components and avoided escape hatches
3. **Analyzes** failures to suggest documentation improvements
4. **Tracks** degradation over conversation length

## Test Protocols

### One-shot

Single turn: inject skill doc → prompt → evaluate

### Degradation

Multi-turn conversation with re-probes:

- Turn 0: Initial probe
- Turns 1-5: Filler questions
- Turn 6: Re-probe
- Turn 7: Distractor ("use Tailwind instead")
- Turn 8: Re-probe
- Turn 9: Recovery (re-inject doc)
- Turn 10: Final re-probe

### Persona Comparison

Run same prompts with different personas:

- **naive**: Plain language, no component names
- **experienced**: Uses correct terminology
- **adversarial**: Mixes in patterns from other frameworks

## Escape Hatches

Tracked behaviors when LLMs deviate from the component system:

**Critical (Red tier - failures):**

- `hallucination` - Invented props/events/components
- `wrong_component` - Using a component incorrectly
- `redundant_css` - CSS that duplicates a component prop

**Anti-Patterns (Yellow tier - break theming):**

- `hardcoded_color` - Direct color values instead of CSS variables
- `hardcoded_spacing` - Direct pixel values instead of spacing tokens
- `hardcoded_size` - Direct pixel values instead of size tokens
- `inline_style` - Inline styles instead of StyleX

**Acceptable (Green tier - gaps in system):**

- `supplemental_css` - StyleX for gaps in component coverage
- `wrapper_div` - Structural HTML for composition
- `custom_animation` - Animation not covered by XDS
- `layout_workaround` - Layout patterns XDS doesn't support

## Quality Tiers

Results are scored into four quality tiers:

- 🥇 **Gold** - Pure XDS, no escape hatches needed
- 🟢 **Green** - Correct components, only acceptable escape hatches
- 🟡 **Yellow** - Anti-patterns that break theming
- 🔴 **Red** - Critical failures

The aggregate report shows tier breakdown by category and generates suggestions for component/API improvements based on escape hatch patterns.

## Configuration

Set skill doc path:

```bash
SKILL_DOC=./path/to/skill.md yarn harness run
# or
yarn harness run --skill-doc ./path/to/skill.md
```

Choose model:

```bash
yarn harness run --model claude-sonnet-4-20250514
yarn harness run --model gpt-4o
```

  HTML Report: results/a1b2c3d4/report.html
```

### HTML Report

The aggregate command generates an interactive HTML report at `results/<iteration>/report.html` that shows:

- Summary stats (success rate, timing, tokens)
- Results by category with progress bars
- Critical issues and escape hatches
- Individual test results with expandable code responses

After analysis:

```
Analyzing iteration a1b2c3d4...

Patterns detected:
  - Multi-step workflows trigger hallucinated state props
  - Adversarial persona causes Tailwind utility usage

Suggested refinements:
  1. [examples] Add multi-step form example (confidence: 0.9, effort: trivial)
  2. [skill_doc] Explicit "do not use Tailwind" note (confidence: 0.7, effort: trivial)
```

## CI Integration

### Screenshot Service (`.github/workflows/vibe-screenshots.yml`)

The primary workflow for nightly vibe tests. Triggered by Navi via `workflow_dispatch`:

```bash
gh workflow run vibe-screenshots.yml -f iterations="<id1>,<id2>,<id3>"
```

**What it does:**

1. Builds self-contained HTML previews from TSX results (inlines all CSS via vite-plugin-singlefile)
2. Captures Playwright screenshots at 4 combos: desktop/mobile × light/dark
3. Uploads preview HTML and screenshots as artifacts (90-day retention)

**No API keys required.** Code generation is handled by Navi sub-agents before this workflow runs.

### Direct API Mode (legacy)

The `test:xds:sample` script calls Anthropic directly and requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. This is the old all-in-one flow — prefer the Navi-orchestrated pipeline for nightly runs.

### Aggregate CLI Flags:

```bash
# Standard output
yarn workspace @xds/vibe-tests aggregate --iteration abc123

# JSON output (for scripting)
yarn workspace @xds/vibe-tests aggregate --iteration abc123 --json

# CI mode (GitHub Actions output format)
yarn workspace @xds/vibe-tests aggregate --iteration abc123 --ci
```
