# XDS

A design system for building internal tools and products.

## Custom Commands

### `/vibe-test [count]` - Run vibeability tests

Tests how well AGENTS.md helps LLMs generate correct XDS component code.

**Usage:**

```
/vibe-test 5                    # Run 5 stratified sample tests (one-shot)
/vibe-test                      # Run all 21 tests (one-shot)
/vibe-test 5 --degradation      # Run 5 tests with degradation curve (10-turn)
```

**How to execute:**

1. Run `yarn workspace @xds/vibe-tests interactive --sample <count> [--degradation]` to set up iteration
2. Spawn parallel subagents (one per test prompt) with `mode: "bypassPermissions"` to:
   - Read the task file from `results/<iteration>/tasks/{promptId}.json`
   - Generate code for the prompt using XDS components (AGENTS.md auto-injected)
   - Self-evaluate for success/escape hatches
   - Write result to individual file: `results/<iteration>/results/{promptId}.json`
3. Run `yarn workspace @xds/vibe-tests aggregate --iteration <id>` to see results

**Degradation mode (--degradation):**
Tests context retention across 10-turn conversations with filler, distractor, and recovery turns.
Probes at turns 0, 6, 8, 10 to measure quality degradation. Results show a line graph of each test's progression.

**Result format:**

```json
{
  "id": "<iter>-<promptId>",
  "timestamp": "...",
  "model": "claude-code-interactive",
  "persona": "naive",
  "promptCategory": "...",
  "trajectoryDepth": 0,
  "prompt": "...",
  "response": "<code>",
  "evaluation": {"success": true, "componentsUsed": [...], "escapeHatches": [...]}
}
```

## AI Context

For architectural context and decisions, see `.context/`:

- `.context/decisions/` — Architecture Decision Records
  - **[API Guidance](/.context/decisions/api-guidance.md)** — Component API conventions (naming, props, styling, state, async actions)
- `.context/explorations/` — Research and brainstorms
- `.context/proposals/` — Feature proposals

## Documentation Standard

This project uses **Fractal Documentation** — a self-referential pattern where documentation exists at three levels:

1. **Project Root** (`README.md`) — Project-wide architecture and directory overview
2. **Directory READMEs** — Each directory contains a `README.md` with file manifests
3. **File Headers** — Each source file has a structured JSDoc header with `@input`, `@output`, `@position`

**Update Protocol**: When modifying code, update:

1. The file's header comment
2. The directory's README.md
3. Parent documentation if architecture changes

Look for `<!-- SYNC: ... -->` comments and `SYNC:` in file headers as reminders.
